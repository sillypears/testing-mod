# testing-mod
A mod for testing Afterbirth items/enemies/whatever. 

The base mod has an edited starting room. The room contains 2 item pedestals (for rolling and/or cheat engine), 2 nerve endings (one at the center and one at the end of the room) with 20,000 HP for damage testing.

I have included the items.xml and itempools.xml in case you'd like to edit those. 

If you do not need the starting room for your testing, you can either rename or delete the 'rooms/00.special rooms.stb' file and you'll get the stock floors.
